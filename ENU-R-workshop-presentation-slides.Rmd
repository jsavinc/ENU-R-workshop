# Seting up project & folders

## Start new project in R

-   File - New Project

![New project prompt in RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/images/docs/projects_new.png)


## Brief aside: absolute vs. relative file paths

-   Absolute paths specify the full 'address' of a file
    -   e.g. "C:/Users/123456/OneDrive - Edinburgh Napier University/training/WORKBOOK.xlsx"
    -   Helpful in some scenarios, e.g. when the data cannot be inside the project folder
-   Relative paths specify the address relative to a 'working directory'
    -   e.g. "./data/raw/WORKBOOK.xlsx"
    -   the dot ('.') means 'working directory'
    -   when using R projects, the working directory is the project folder
    -   two dots ('..') means 'move one directory up' - e.g. "../other project folder/data/raw_data.csv"


## Project skeleton

It's good practice to structure your project folders in a way that makes things easier to find, e.g.:

- raw data
- scripts
- clean data
- figures
- models

The best layout will vary from project to project, but a bit of preparation ahead of time can save you trouble later on!


# Data frames/tibbles

## What are data frames/tibbles?

-   Data frames (or tibbles, in tidyverse) are like spreadsheets in R
-   Rectangular structure: rows X columns
-   Each column has a *type*:
    -   character (any text you like!)
    -   integer (integers, 0,1,2,3,...)
    -   numeric (e.g. decimal numbers)
    -   logical (TRUE/FALSE)

## Addressing / indexing values in data frames

-   Each entry in a data frame/tibble has an 'address' - its position in terms of rows and columns
-   You can refer to values in a data frame using an index in rectangular brackets:
    -   df[3,5] refers to the value in data frame *df* at row 3 and column 5
-   Columns have names, so you can also refer to a named column:
    -   df[2, "smoking status"] refers to 2nd row, column "smoking status"
    
## Addressing / indexing values in data frames
    
-   Special case: you can leave out the row or column position, and it will get all rows or all columns
    -   df[6,] refers to row 6 and all columns
    -   df[,9] refers to all rows and column 9
    -   df[, ] refers to all of df (the same as calling df directly!)

## Dollar sign notation (\$)

-   You can also refer to a column using the dollar sign ('$'): - df$postcode refers to the 'postcode' column - note there's no quotes around the name in this case!

## Functions on data frames

-   running just the name of the data frame/tibble, e.g. `df` is the same as running `print(df)` and will show you the first 10 rows of the data
-   `summary(df)` runs some very basic descriptive statistics on all the columns
-   `glimpse(df)` (part of the *tidyverse* package) shows you all the columns and lists the first few values for each column

## Saving data frames as files

-   To save a data frame as a file, you can use the following:
    -   `write_csv(df,  file = "path_to_file.csv")` saves the data frame as a .csv file
    -   `openxlsx::write.xlsx(df, "path_to_file.xlsx")` saves the data frame as an excel (.xlsx) file
    
    
# Reading excel files

## Reading excel files

- Excel files can have multiple sheets/tabs
- `{readxl}` package for reading excel files
- `excel_sheets()` shows you the names of the sheets/tabs
- `read_excel()` will read a specific sheet/tab from an excel file (you need to specify the name or the number of the sheet!)
  - e.g. `read_excel(path = "my_excel_file.xlsx", sheet = 2)` will read the 2nd tab in the file
- Read specific cell range in sheet: `read_excel(path = "my_excel_file.xlsx", sheet = 2, range = "A5:G24")`


# Data cleaning

## Data cleaning

- Real world data are messy, often data are collected without a clear idea of how they will be analysed, so a lot of processing is needed
- Pareto principle: 80% of effort goes into data cleaning, 80% of the effort of data cleaning is spent on 20% of data, etc.
- Often, you'll need to make arbitrary decisions, especially when dealing with near-duplicate entries
  - i.e. do you keep the first entry, the last entry?
  - often there's no 'correct' way to proceed with cleaning, so make sure you justify and document your decisions - transparency!


## Never modify raw data!

- Keep raw data untouched (preferably save a separate copy elsewhere as backup)
- With R it's easy to document all steps of data cleaning
- Load raw data, process it, and save a new, clean file
  - Sometimes it's useful to keep intermediate files as well


## {janitor} package

The {janitor} package contains many helpful functions used in data cleaning:

- `clean_names()` makes consistent variable names: from `"Treatment  assignment (BRIEF)"` to `"treatment_assignment_brief"`
- `convert_to_date()` for converting from excel's quirky date format
- `remove_constant()` will find columns that only contain the same entry throughout and remove them
- `remove_empty_rows()`, `remove_empty_cols()`
- `get_dupes()` for finding duplicate rows


## Naming conventions

- as with other standards, there are many!
- consistency is key
- use descriptive names, length is not a problem (e.g. avoid cryptic names like `NEWVAR12`)
- variable names can use spaces but that makes your life a little more difficult
- recommended reading: [Column Names as Contracts](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/column-name-contracts/)
- suggestions: 
  - include type of variable (e.g. 'val', 'amt', 'cat', 'bin', etc.)
  - lower-case names separated by underscores
  - e.g. `id_participant`, `amt_age_at_census`, `cat_age_of_child`, `bin_treatment_group`


## Renaming columns in R

- Common theme in R: there's about 10 different ways of doing anything
- aforementioned `janitor::clean_names()` - this takes existing names and 'cleans' them
- {dplyr} has function `rename()`: e.g. `some_data %>% rename(new_variable_with_descriptive_name = NEWVAR12)` - you can pick individual columns to rename
  - you can rename them programmatically as well, e.g., replace all numbers with blank (equivalent to removing)
  - `some_data %>% rename_with(~str_replace_all(string = .x, pattern = "\\d", replacement = ""))`
  - `some_data %>% rename_with(~str_remove_all(string = .x, pattern = "\\d"))`
- base R example:
  - `names(some_data) <- c("id_patient", "cat_group_asignment", "amt_heart_rate")`
  - the above fails if there aren't exactly 3 columns in the data!
  
## Missing values

- R has an in-built marker for missing values, `NA`
- missing values can be coded in various ways; e.g. NHS ethnicity data contains codes for 'Refused', 'Not known', or the data may be actually missing.
  - when cleaning data, we usually want to convert them all to R's `NA`
  - `if_else(condition = age_var == 999, true = NA_integer_, false = age_var)`
  - `if_else(condition = eth_var %in% c("Refused", "Not known"), true = NA_character_, false = eth_var)`
- conversely, sometimes you want to make missing values a separate category, e.g. `replace_na(replace = "Missing data")`
