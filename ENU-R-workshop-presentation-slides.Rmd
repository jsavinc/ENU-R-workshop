# Seting up project & folders

## Start new project in R

- File - New Project

TODO: include a screenshot of the New Project window!

## File paths: absolute vs. relative

- Absolute paths specify the full 'address' of a file
  - e.g. "C:/Users/123456/OneDrive - Edinburgh Napier University/training/WORKBOOK.xlsx"
  - Helpful in some scenarios, e.g. when the data cannot be inside the project folder
- Relative paths specify the address relative to a 'working directory'
  - e.g. "./data/raw/WORKBOOK.xlsx"
  - the dot ('.') means 'working directory'
  - when using R projects, the working directory is the project folder
  - two dots ('..') means 'move one directory up' - e.g. "../other project folder/data/raw_data.csv"
